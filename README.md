## Key Functionalities

### 1. **Search and Display Games**
- The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch game data via API calls.
- Implemented dynamic rendering of game cards using Angular templates.

### 2. **User Authentication**
- The backend handles user login and signup securely.
- User data is passed between components using Angular services and state management.

### 3. **Favorites Management**
- The application allows users to add games to their favorites list.
